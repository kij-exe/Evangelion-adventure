Go to code and open main.py to start the game
If there is an error, try to type into powershell "pip install pygame --pre"
This error occurs with the new version of Python
If this did not help, try to open the game with some IDE (e.g., IDLE)

The game does not suggest many plot or playability, 
however I tried to implement some mechanics that might be interesting further:
once the game is opened, you can walk arround with a character;
there is another one on the map, to switch between them press V;
camera smoothly follows you, maintaing player at the center of the screen;
if constants SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGTH in the file config are changed to somtheing
that has proportion of 16:9, everything in the main menu will scale;
you can switch debug mode with key Y. It will show you fps and hitboxes.

Thank you :)
